In order to start task, please download the file and drag 'OV7675' and 'Bag_Classification_inferencing' into Arduino library first.

If you want to use camera to make real photo and recongize, please open into: /Users/<username>/Documents/Arduino/libraries/Bag_Classification_inferencing/examples/nano_ble33_sense/nano_ble33_sense_camera/nano_ble33_sense_camera.ino
(Based on different setting, the file path could be different)

Open the 'nano_ble33_sense_camera.ino' file using Arduino IDE, as show below
